# Simple Vue Weather App

This was created simply to get comfortable with Vue.js.

I followed [Tyler Potss'](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBBGM84ZOs7z5jpTQAaZ_Hg) tutorial on YouTube found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLc-hWsPTUY&).

To use this you need a [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) API Key and set it in a .env file.
